  <summary>What is a Feedback Survey?
  </summary>

 A feedback survey is a process for measuring the happiness and satisfaction of consumers. You can either use the built-in or custom dialog flows to capture feedback. You can also push the feedback to the platform using the public API against a feedback survey without triggering a dialog.
