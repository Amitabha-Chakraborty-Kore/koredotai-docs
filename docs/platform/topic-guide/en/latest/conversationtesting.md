  <summary>What is the use of Dynamic Text Marker?
  </summary>


 
   In cases where you feel the VA response has dynamic values like Bank Balance, Number of available seats and so on, you can mark a selected portion of the response as dynamic. For example, “Your account balance is $65”. You can mark ‘$65’ as dynamic by clicking on the brush icon and selecting the text in Expected Output. The marked portion will be ignored by the platform while performing text assertion.
