  <summary>What is the use of Conversation Insights?
  </summary>
The Conversation Insights module aims to provide a structured approach for analysts to regularly review and improve the NLU performance. Utterance clusters are formed using deep neural models and each cluster is assigned with a name that is representative of the underlying utterances. These clusters are presented using a visual heat map. You can also switch to the tabular view, to see the list of all intents and the corresponding clusters under these intents to identify false positive, false negative, and opportunities to train new intents.
